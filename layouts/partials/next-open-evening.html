<span class="next-open-evening-date">Covid-19 Update: Build Brighton reamins open in compliance with social distancing guidelines, but we are currently unable to take on new 
  members outside of tier 1 due to restrictions on indoor mixing between households. 
<br /><br />
There are currently spaces available, so if you are interested in joining as restrictions lift, please email info@buildbrighton.com and we will contact you as soon as we are able 
to accept and induct new members. 
<br /><br />
Face masks and sanitiser are used throughout the space, while members currently book sessions via an online booking system to ensure optimal numbers at any one time. 
<br /><br />
All equipment is cleaned down before and after use, and members submit photographs as they enter and leave the space to ensure hygeine is met. Build Brighton is also participating in track and trace to protect its members, whose details are logged electronically upon entry to the workshop. 
<br /><br />
Open evenings are usually held once every two weeks, so please do email info@buildbrighton.com to be alerted as they resume</span>
