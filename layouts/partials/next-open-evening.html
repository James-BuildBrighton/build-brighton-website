<span class="next-open-evening-date">Covid-19 Update: Build Brighton is currently closed for the duration of the national lockdown. Where and when local restrictions allow, we will re-open in compliance with social distancing guidelines as we did previously. 
<br /><br />
Face masks and sanitiser are used throughout the space, with sessions booked via an online booking system to ensure numbers remain below 6 at any one time. 
<br /><br />
All equipment is cleaned down before and after use, and members submit photographs as they enter and leave the space to ensure hygeine is met. Build Brighton is also participating in track and trace to protect its members, whose details are logged electronically upon entry to the workshop.  
<br /><br />
When we re-open, we will be looking for new members as we have a number of spaces available. If you're interested in joining, please email info@buildbrighton.com and we will update you as soon as we're ready to re-open</span>
