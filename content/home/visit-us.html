        <p><strong>Open evenings are every Thursday at 8pm.</strong> They are an informal event where members regularly come to work on projects, get help, share ideas and socialise. Itâ€™s also the best opportunity for visitors to come along for the first time.</p>
        <p>You can get a feel for the type of projects being worked on, meet some of our members and see the equipment and resources we have.</p>
