We’re part of a global network of makerspaces – places where people do creative projects, such as electronics, 3D printing, crafts, woodworking and food hacking. Our main purpose is to provide tools and a space in which our members can gather, collaborate and learn from each other. People can beaver away on their own projects, or take part in exciting group projects in a playful and friendly environment.

We are a not-for-profit community run entirely by volunteers. Our members pay a monthly subscription that goes towards paying for the workshop space and providing equipment, amenities and assets for the group.
